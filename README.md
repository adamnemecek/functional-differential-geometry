# Functional Differential Geometry

Working my way through Sussman and Wisdom's Functional Differential Geometry
and implementing it in Python.

The modules should work in both Python 2 and 3.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jtauber/functional-differential-geometry.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jtauber/functional-differential-geometry)

## tuples.py

Implements the datastructures in the *Tuples* section of *Appendix B*. I
actually really wish Python tuples worked this way :-)

`tuples.rst` explains the module.

## functions.py

Implements the functional capabilities described in the *Functions* section of
*Appendix B*. I guess I wish Python functions worked this way too :-)

`functions.rst` explains the module.
