# Functional Differential Geometry

Working my way through Sussman and Wisdom's Functional Differential Geometry
and implementing it in Python.

The modules should work in both Python 2 and 3.

## tuples.py

Implements the datastructures in the *Tuples* section of *Appendix B*. I
actually really wish Python tuples worked this way :-)

`tuples.rst` explains the module.

## functions.py

Implements the functional capabilities described in the *Functions* section of
*Appendix B*. I guess I wish Python functions worked this way too :-)

`functions.rst` explains the module.

## symbolic.py

Implements some of the symbolic value functionality needed for *Appendix B*.

`symbolic.rst` explains the module.
