# Functional Differential Geometry

Working my way through Sussman and Wisdom's Functional Differential Geometry
and implementing it in Python.

## tuples.py

Implements the datastructures in the *Tuples* section of *Appendix B*. I
actually really wish Python tuples worked this way :-)

`tuples.rst` explains the module.

The module should work in both Python 2 and 3.
